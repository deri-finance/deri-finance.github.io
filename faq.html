                    <span>
                        So far, Deri is deployed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Huobi ECO Chain (Heco) and within one unified ecosytem organized by the token DERI. <br>
                        Hence the slogan: Three Chains, One Ecosystem.

                <div class="title">How much gas is consumed to do things with Deri?</div>
                <div class="title_text">
                    <span>
                        Deri protocol is reasonably gas-economic. Most of the actions cost around 100,000 gas per action. The most expensive action is trade-with-margin, a combined action of trade and post margin, that costs around 200,000 gas per action. <br><br>
                        If you are to trade frequently, it is encouraged to post sufficient margin to your position (i.e. your pToken) and carry out "simple trades" without adding/removing margin every time, which would cost around 100,000 gas per trade.<br><br>
                        If you do not have a clear sense about how much 100,000 gas is, this is for your reference: the minimum gas consumption of a single transaction on ETH blockchain is sending ETH, which costs 21,000 gas per transfer, while a common basic transaction like sending ERC20 token (e.g. USDT or DAI) costs around 40,000~60,000 gas.<b>That is, a single operation with Deri consumes only around twice as much gas as an simple transfer of ERC20 token.</b>

                        For the time being:<br>
                        <li class='li'><b>Profits of the base token</b>  in which you provide liquidity. Please note that this part of return is not certain: there is a possibility of loss (i.e. impermanent loss). However, the probability of impermanent loss on Deri liquidity farming is much smaller than that of Uniswap due to the protection of arbitragers.
                            <br>
                            This part of yield is included in the increment of share value of the liquidity shares. You will get the profit when you withdraw liquidity from the pool. 
                        </li><br>
                        
                        <li class='li'><b>Yield of DERI token</b>. DERIs, the protocol tokens are distributed to liquidity providers according to their liquidity contributions on a weekly basis. Unlike the base token profits, this part of yields is certain. It's proportional to the dollar value and the time length (i.e. timed value) of your liquidity contribution.

                        No, it is not. Liquidity mining on Deri pools are subject to the risk of impermanent loss. However, the probability of impermanent loss on Deri liquidity farming is much smaller than that of Uniswap due to the protection by arbitragers.<br><br>
                        You might think of liquidity mining on Deri as investing in a low-risk fund with potentially very high profit, whereas those risk-free liquidity mining are like depositing your money into bank saving account.

                        As governance token, the whole Deri system & community governance will be based on DERI.
                        As fee token, it will be used in a number of scenarios in the Deri trading, such as paying for transaction fee (to be developed), bidding for pool-launching, staking to be a qualified liquidator, etc.
