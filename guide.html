                        <ol>
                            <li class='li'>From the pool list page, click the "Trade" button to enter the trading page of the pool you would like to trade with</li>
                            <li class='li'>Choose long/short direction and fill out the position (number of contracts) you would like to take  </li>
                            <li class='li'>Choose an appropriate  leverage (alternatively, you can specify a precise margin to post if you are familiar with the leverage-margin calculation</li>
                            <li class='li'>Click the "PLACE ORDER" button</li>
                            <li class='li'>Review the order details on the dialog box and click the "CONFIRM" button to proceed to the wallet confirmation</li>
                        </ol> 
                        Then there you go - the pool will establish your position. That is, the pool will mint an ERC721 token to your address, which is how your position exists on the ethereum blockchain. <br><br>
                        If you would like to add some position in the same direction, simply repeat the steps above.<br><br>
                        <b>How to close a position?</b><br><br>
                        Let's assume you have long position of 10 contracts, if you would like to partially or completely close the position, simply short the number of contracts (no more than 10) you would like to close as if you were entering the opposite position, except that you don't need to post margin any more. Likewise for closing a short position.<br><br>
                        When you partially or completely close a position, the part of the unrealized PnL associated to the part of the closed position will become realized - the pool will automatically apply that to your margin (i.e. add or substract base tokens from your margin).

                        When you successfully place an order (i.e. with sufficient margin posted), you have a PToken minted to your address on Ethereum blockchain. PToken (P for position) is a non-fungible token (NFT) containing your position information: direction&volume, cost, your margin, cumulative funding rate at the minting block.<br><br>
                        The PToken is how your position exists on the ethereum blockchain. You can send it to another address just like you send any NFT or fungible token (e.g. ERC20 token). That is, PToken is a tokenized position. Or, from a financial perspective, it's a tokenized risk exposure.

                        To balance the two sides of long and short positions, the pool will always apply a funding fee to the majority side.<br><br>
                        For each ETH block, assuming the total number of contracts in long position is L while that in short position is S. Then every single long contract will pay a funding fee = FundingRate, per the following formula. Whereas every single short contract will receive a funding fee = FundingRate.<br><br>
                         <i>FundingRate = r*NetPositionContractValue/PoolLiquidity</i> <br><br>
                         <i>=r*(L-S)*CurrentPrice*Multiplier/PoolLiquidity</i><br><br>
                         where r is the funding rate coefficient<br><br>
                         Please note that when L>S, FundingRate is positive (meaning long positions pay short positions), whereas when L&lt;S, FundingRate is negative (short positions pay long positions).

                        The pool uses the price in external exchanges (fed by oracle) as the mark price to calculate position PnL. Since the pool will always apply a funding fee to the majority side. Therefore a very simple arbitrage strategy is to take the minority side of the pool. This involves the following steps:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li class='li'>Read the current funding rate of the pool. when it's positive(negative), enter a short(long) position.</li>
                            <li class='li'>Accordingly hedge your short/long position outside (e.g. hold a spot position or take a position on a CeFi exchange as you wish).</li>
                            <li class='li'>Sit back and enjoy collecting the funding earning (i.e. negative funding fee) as long as the sign of the funding rate does not flip.</li>
                        </ol> <br>
                        Note: obviously you want to take transaction costs into account when establishing your arbitrage positions.
